This repo is used to run a league for students' Connect4 agents.

### Ideas

- How to run the tournament from a python file? I don't want to block resources, 
so I need to find a way to launch processes at specific times.
- What to run? Games with empty boards (each agent starts once) and games with 
random starting positions?


- How to incorporate different agents? Automation like Owen did is risky. Git 
submodules?

- We need code to run the league

- What to store from games and how? Maybe it would be useful to have one
database with all the raw info and then have code that reads that out.
